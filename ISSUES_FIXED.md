# Issues Fixed ✅

## 1. ✅ **Syntax Error in useAiModels.ts**

**Error**: 
```
Expected a semicolon
Expression expected
× Syntax Error
```

**Root Cause**: The `finally` block was misplaced outside the try-catch structure, causing invalid JavaScript syntax.

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed misplaced `finally` block
- Moved `setLoading(false)` to the end of the function
- Cleaned up the control flow structure

**Result**: ✅ TypeScript compilation now succeeds without errors.

## 2. ✅ **Port Conflict - Server Starting on Port 3000**

**Issue**: Next.js dev server was trying to start on port 3000 which was already in use by another project.

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Updated package.json**:
   ```json
   "dev": "next dev --port 3001"
   ```

2. **Updated .env.local**:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3001
   ```

**Result**: ✅ Server now starts on port 3001 to avoid conflicts.

## Summary

### Files Modified:
1. `src/hooks/useAiModels.ts` - Fixed syntax error with proper control flow
2. `package.json` - Changed dev script to use port 3001
3. `.env.local` - Updated app URL to match new port

### Technical Improvements:
- **Clean Syntax**: Removed invalid finally block
- **Port Isolation**: Dev server uses dedicated port to avoid conflicts
- **Environment Consistency**: App URL matches server port

### Current Status:
- ✅ TypeScript compiles without errors
- ✅ Dev server configured for port 3001
- ✅ No syntax errors in codebase
- ✅ Ready for development on isolated port

## Next Steps for User:
1. Run `npm run dev` in the nextjs-migration directory
2. Access the app at `http://localhost:3001`
3. The app should load without port conflicts or console errors

The Next.js migration is now properly configured with a clean syntax and dedicated port!
