# Infinite Loop Fixes for Production Build

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. React Strict Mode + AuthProvider Redirects
**Problem**: The production config had `reactStrictMode: true` while the main config had it disabled. In React Strict Mode, effects run twice, and the AuthProvider had `window.location.href` redirects that caused infinite loops.

**Solution**: 
- Disabled React Strict Mode in both configs to prevent double effect execution
- Replaced `window.location.href` with Next.js router navigation
- Added redirect prevention logic using `useRef` to prevent multiple redirects

**Files Modified**:
- `next.config.ts` - Disabled React Strict Mode
- `next.config.production.ts` - Disabled React Strict Mode  
- `src/lib/auth/provider.tsx` - Fixed redirect logic

### 2. PerformanceMonitor Network Calls
**Problem**: The PerformanceMonitor was making network calls every 5 seconds, which could cause issues in production and potentially infinite loops.

**Solution**:
- Reduced network call frequency in production (10s vs 5s in dev)
- Added network call prevention logic to avoid overlapping requests
- Added timeout and error handling for network requests
- Disabled network latency monitoring in production by default

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/PerformanceMonitor.tsx` - Improved network call handling

### 3. Middleware Redirect Logic
**Problem**: The middleware had redirect logic that could potentially cause loops, especially with auth state changes.

**Solution**:
- Added try-catch error handling to prevent crashes
- Improved redirect conditions to be more specific
- Added better logging for debugging

**Files Modified**:
- `src/middleware.ts` - Added error handling and improved redirect logic

## Key Changes Made

### AuthProvider (`src/lib/auth/provider.tsx`)
```typescript
// Before: Using window.location.href (causes infinite loops)
window.location.href = '/dashboard';

// After: Using Next.js router with redirect prevention
const redirectInProgress = useRef(false);
if (event === 'SIGNED_IN' && session && !redirectInProgress.current) {
  redirectInProgress.current = true;
  router.push('/dashboard');
}
```

### PerformanceMonitor (`src/components/PerformanceMonitor.tsx`)
```typescript
// Before: Network calls every 5 seconds in all environments
setInterval(() => {
  measureNetworkLatency();
}, 5000);

// After: Reduced frequency and better error handling
const interval = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 10000 : 5000;
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  measureNetworkLatency();
}
```

### Next.js Configs
```typescript
// Before: Inconsistent React Strict Mode settings
reactStrictMode: true, // production
reactStrictMode: false, // development

// After: Consistent settings to prevent infinite loops
reactStrictMode: false, // both environments
```

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Run the Test Script
```bash
node scripts/test-production.js
```

This script will:
- Clean previous builds
- Install dependencies
- Build the application
- Start the production server for testing

### 2. Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Application builds without errors
- [ ] Production server starts successfully
- [ ] No infinite redirects on page load
- [ ] Authentication flows work correctly
- [ ] Performance monitoring doesn't cause issues
- [ ] No console errors related to infinite loops

### 3. Browser Testing
- Open browser developer tools
- Check for any infinite network requests
- Verify that auth state changes don't cause loops
- Test navigation between pages

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Code Review Guidelines
- Always use Next.js router instead of `window.location.href`
- Add proper cleanup in `useEffect` hooks
- Use `useRef` to prevent multiple executions
- Add error boundaries around critical components

### 2. Development Practices
- Test in production mode regularly
- Use React DevTools to monitor re-renders
- Monitor network requests in browser dev tools
- Add logging for auth state changes

### 3. Configuration Best Practices
- Keep React Strict Mode disabled until all components are stable
- Use consistent config settings across environments
- Add proper error handling in middleware
- Monitor performance in production

## Monitoring and Debugging

### 1. Console Logging
The AuthProvider now includes logging for auth state changes:
```typescript
console.log('Auth state changed:', event, session?.user?.email);
```

### 2. Performance Monitoring
The PerformanceMonitor is disabled in production by default but can be enabled for debugging:
```typescript
enabled = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
```

### 3. Error Boundaries
The application includes ErrorBoundary components to catch and handle errors gracefully.

## Future Considerations

### 1. Re-enabling React Strict Mode
Once all components are stable and tested, consider re-enabling React Strict Mode:
```typescript
reactStrictMode: true
```

### 2. Performance Monitoring
Consider implementing a more robust performance monitoring solution that doesn't rely on frequent network calls.

### 3. Auth State Management
Consider using a more robust auth state management solution like Zustand or Redux Toolkit for better control over state updates.
